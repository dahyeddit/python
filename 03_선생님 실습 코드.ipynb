      "\n",
      "Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the\n",
      "bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the\n",
      "book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in\n",
      "it, ‘and what is the use of a book,’ thought Alice ‘without pictures or\n",
      "conversations?’\n",
      "\n",
      "So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the\n",
      "hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure\n",
      "of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and\n",
      "picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran\n",
      "close by her.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so\n",
      "VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, ‘Oh dear!\n",
      "Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it\n",
      "occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time\n",
      "it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH\n",
      "OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on,\n",
      "Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had\n",
      "never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch\n",
      "to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field\n",
      "after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large\n",
      "rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how\n",
      "in the world she was to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then\n",
      "dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think\n",
      "about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep\n",
      "well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had\n",
      "plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was\n",
      "going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what\n",
      "she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\n",
      "looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\n",
      "cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\n",
      "hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as\n",
      "she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great\n",
      "disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\n",
      "of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as\n",
      "she fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall\n",
      "think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at\n",
      "home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top\n",
      "of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! ‘I wonder how\n",
      "many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting\n",
      "somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four\n",
      "thousand miles down, I think--’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several\n",
      "things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this\n",
      "was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there\n",
      "was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)\n",
      "‘--yes, that’s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n",
      "or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or\n",
      "Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the\n",
      "earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with\n",
      "their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--’ (she was rather glad\n",
      "there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the\n",
      "right word) ‘--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country\n",
      "is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and\n",
      "she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you’re falling\n",
      "through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an\n",
      "ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to\n",
      "ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\n",
      "talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’\n",
      "(Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at\n",
      "tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no\n",
      "mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very\n",
      "like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice\n",
      "began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy\n",
      "sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question,\n",
      "it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing\n",
      "off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with\n",
      "Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:\n",
      "did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon\n",
      "a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:\n",
      "she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another\n",
      "long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.\n",
      "There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and\n",
      "was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears\n",
      "and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she\n",
      "turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging\n",
      "from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",
      "Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every\n",
      "door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to\n",
      "get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it\n",
      "would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could\n",
      "shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.’\n",
      "For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately,\n",
      "that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really\n",
      "impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",
      "back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at\n",
      "any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this\n",
      "time she found a little bottle on it, [‘which certainly was not here\n",
      "before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper\n",
      "label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large\n",
      "letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was\n",
      "not going to do THAT in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and\n",
      "see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice\n",
      "little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild\n",
      "beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember\n",
      "the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot\n",
      "poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never\n",
      "forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is\n",
      "almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, this bottle was NOT marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste\n",
      "it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour\n",
      "of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot\n",
      "buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n",

      "‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a\n",
      "telescope.’\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face\n",
      "brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going\n",
      "through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she\n",
      "waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further:\n",
      "she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said\n",
      "Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder\n",
      "what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a\n",
      "candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n",
      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going\n",
      "into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the\n",
      "door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she\n",
      "went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach\n",
      "it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her\n",
      "best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;\n",
      "and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing\n",
      "sat down and cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself,\n",
      "rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally\n",
      "gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it),\n",
      "and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into\n",
      "her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having\n",
      "cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself,\n",
      "for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.\n",
      "‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people!\n",
      "Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table:\n",
      "she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words\n",
      "‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said\n",
      "Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it\n",
      "makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll\n",
      "get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which\n",
      "way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was\n",
      "growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same\n",
      "size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice\n",
      "had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way\n",
      "things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on\n",
      "in the common way.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.\n",

      "for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); ‘now I’m\n",
      "opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!’\n",
      "(for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of\n",
      "sight, they were getting so far off). ‘Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder\n",
      "who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’m sure\n",

      "Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was\n",

      "\n",
      "Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to\n",

      "\n",
      "     ‘How doth the little crocodile\n",

      "\n",
      "‘I’m sure those are not the right words,’ said poor Alice, and her eyes\n",
      "filled with tears again as she went on, ‘I must be Mabel after all, and\n",
      "I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\n",
      "no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I’ve\n",

      "of tears, ‘I do wish they WOULD put their heads down! I am so VERY tired\n",
      "of being all alone here!’\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see\n",
      "that she had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while\n",
      "she was talking. ‘How CAN I have done that?’ she thought. ‘I must\n",
      "be growing small again.’ She got up and went to the table to measure\n",
      "herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now\n",
      "about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found\n",
      "out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped\n",
      "it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That WAS a narrow escape!’ said Alice, a good deal frightened at the\n",
      "sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; ‘and\n",
      "now for the garden!’ and she ran with all speed back to the little door:\n",
      "but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was\n",
      "lying on the glass table as before, ‘and things are worse than ever,’\n",
      "thought the poor child, ‘for I never was so small as this before, never!\n",
      "And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!’\n",
      "\n",
      "As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash!\n",
      "she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she\n",
      "had somehow fallen into the sea, ‘and in that case I can go back by\n",
      "railway,’ she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in\n",
      "her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go\n",
      "to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the\n",
      "sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row\n",
      "of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon\n",
      "made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she\n",
      "was nine feet high.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish I hadn’t cried so much!’ said Alice, as she swam about, trying\n",
      "to find her way out. ‘I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by\n",
      "being drowned in my own tears! That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure!\n",
      "However, everything is queer to-day.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\n",
      "off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\n",
      "it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\n",
      "she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\n",
      "slipped in like herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Would it be of any use, now,’ thought Alice, ‘to speak to this mouse?\n",
      "Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\n",
      "likely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.’ So she\n",
      "began: ‘O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\n",
      "of swimming about here, O Mouse!’ (Alice thought this must be the right\n",
      "way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\n",
      "she remembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, ‘A mouse--of\n",
      "a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!’) The Mouse looked at her rather\n",
      "inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\n",
      "but it said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,’ thought Alice; ‘I daresay it’s\n",
      "a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.’ (For, with all\n",
      "her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\n",
      "anything had happened.) So she began again: ‘Ou est ma chatte?’ which\n",
      "was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\n",
      "sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.\n",
      "‘Oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt\n",
      "the poor animal’s feelings. ‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not like cats!’ cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. ‘Would\n",
      "YOU like cats if you were me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Alice in a soothing tone: ‘don’t be angry\n",
      "about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you’d\n",
      "take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet\n",
      "thing,’ Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the\n",
      "pool, ‘and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and\n",
      "washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she’s\n",
      "such a capital one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!’ cried\n",
      "Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she\n",
      "felt certain it must be really offended. ‘We won’t talk about her any\n",
      "more if you’d rather not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We indeed!’ cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\n",
      "tail. ‘As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED\n",
      "cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the name again!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I won’t indeed!’ said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\n",
      "conversation. ‘Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?’ The Mouse did not\n",
      "answer, so Alice went on eagerly: ‘There is such a nice little dog near\n",
      "our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\n",
      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it’ll fetch things when\n",
      "you throw them, and it’ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\n",
      "of things--I can’t remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer,\n",
      "you know, and he says it’s so useful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He\n",
      "says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!’ cried Alice in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone, ‘I’m afraid I’ve offended it again!’ For the Mouse was swimming\n",
      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she called softly after it, ‘Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\n",
      "won’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t like them!’ When the\n",
      "Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its\n",
      "face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\n",
      "trembling voice, ‘Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tell you my\n",
      "history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the\n",
      "birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo,\n",
      "a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the\n",
      "way, and the whole party swam to the shore.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale\n",
      "\n",
      "They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the\n",
      "birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close\n",
      "to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",
      "consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural\n",
      "to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had\n",
      "known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the\n",
      "Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, ‘I am older than\n",
      "you, and must know better’; and this Alice would not allow without\n",
      "knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its\n",
      "age, there was no more to be said.\n",
      "\n",
      "At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,\n",
      "called out, ‘Sit down, all of you, and listen to me! I’LL soon make you\n",
      "dry enough!’ They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse\n",
      "in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt\n",
      "sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ahem!’ said the Mouse with an important air, ‘are you all ready? This\n",
      "is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! “William\n",
      "the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted\n",
      "to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Ugh!’ said the Lory, with a shiver.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I beg your pardon!’ said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: ‘Did\n",
      "you speak?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not I!’ said the Lory hastily.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought you did,’ said the Mouse. ‘--I proceed. “Edwin and Morcar,\n",
      "the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand,\n",
      "the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--“’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Found WHAT?’ said the Duck.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Found IT,’ the Mouse replied rather crossly: ‘of course you know what\n",
      "“it” means.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I know what “it” means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the\n",
      "Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the\n",
      "archbishop find?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, ‘“--found\n",
      "it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the\n",
      "crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his\n",
      "Normans--” How are you getting on now, my dear?’ it continued, turning\n",
      "to Alice as it spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As wet as ever,’ said Alice in a melancholy tone: ‘it doesn’t seem to\n",
      "dry me at all.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In that case,’ said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, ‘I move\n",
      "that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic\n",
      "remedies--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Speak English!’ said the Eaglet. ‘I don’t know the meaning of half\n",
      "those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believe you do either!’ And\n",
      "the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds\n",
      "tittered audibly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What I was going to say,’ said the Dodo in an offended tone, ‘was, that\n",
      "the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What IS a Caucus-race?’ said Alice; not that she wanted much to know,\n",
      "but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak,\n",
      "and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why,’ said the Dodo, ‘the best way to explain it is to do it.’ (And, as\n",
      "you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell\n",
      "you how the Dodo managed it.)\n",
      "\n",
      "First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, [‘the exact\n",
      "shape doesn’t matter,’ it said,) and then all the party were placed\n",
      "along the course, here and there. There was no ‘One, two, three, and\n",
      "away,’ but they began running when they liked, and left off when they\n",
      "liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However,\n",
      "when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again,\n",
      "the Dodo suddenly called out ‘The race is over!’ and they all crowded\n",
      "round it, panting, and asking, ‘But who has won?’\n",
      "\n",
      "This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought,\n",
      "and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead\n",
      "(the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures\n",
      "of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said,\n",
      "‘EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But who is to give the prizes?’ quite a chorus of voices asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, SHE, of course,’ said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger;\n",
      "and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused\n",
      "way, ‘Prizes! Prizes!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her\n",
      "pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had\n",
      "not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one\n",
      "a-piece all round.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But she must have a prize herself, you know,’ said the Mouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course,’ the Dodo replied very gravely. ‘What else have you got in\n",
      "your pocket?’ he went on, turning to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only a thimble,’ said Alice sadly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hand it over here,’ said the Dodo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly\n",
      "presented the thimble, saying ‘We beg your acceptance of this elegant\n",
      "thimble’; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave\n",
      "that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything\n",
      "to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and\n",
      "confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste\n",
      "theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.\n",
      "However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and\n",
      "begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You promised to tell me your history, you know,’ said Alice, ‘and why\n",
      "it is you hate--C and D,’ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it\n",
      "would be offended again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mine is a long and a sad tale!’ said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and\n",
      "sighing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It IS a long tail, certainly,’ said Alice, looking down with wonder at\n",
      "the Mouse’s tail; ‘but why do you call it sad?’ And she kept on puzzling\n",
      "about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was\n",

      "It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking\n",
      "anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard\n",
      "it muttering to itself ‘The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh\n",
      "my fur and whiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are\n",
      "ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?’ Alice guessed in a\n",
      "moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,\n",
      "and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were\n",
      "nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in\n",
      "the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door,\n",
      "had vanished completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and\n",
      "called out to her in an angry tone, ‘Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing\n",
      "out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!\n",
      "Quick, now!’ And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once\n",
      "in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it\n",
      "had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He took me for his housemaid,’ she said to herself as she ran. ‘How\n",
      "surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’d better take him\n",
      "his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.’ As she said this, she\n",
      "came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass\n",
      "plate with the name ‘W. RABBIT’ engraved upon it. She went in without\n",
      "knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the\n",
      "real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the\n",
      "fan and gloves.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How queer it seems,’ Alice said to herself, ‘to be going messages for\n",
      "a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messages next!’ And she\n",
      "began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: ‘“Miss Alice! Come\n",
      "here directly, and get ready for your walk!” “Coming in a minute,\n",
      "nurse! But I’ve got to see that the mouse doesn’t get out.” Only I don’t\n",
      "think,’ Alice went on, ‘that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it\n",
      "began ordering people about like that!’\n",
      "\n",
      "By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table\n",
      "in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs\n",
      "of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,\n",
      "and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little\n",
      "bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time\n",
      "with the words ‘DRINK ME,’ but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it\n",
      "to her lips. ‘I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,’ she said\n",
      "to herself, ‘whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see what\n",
      "this bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for really\n",
      "I’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!’\n",
      "\n",
      "It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had\n",
      "drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling,\n",
      "and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put\n",
      "down the bottle, saying to herself ‘That’s quite enough--I hope I shan’t\n",
      "grow any more--As it is, I can’t get out at the door--I do wish I hadn’t\n",
      "drunk quite so much!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing,\n",
      "and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there\n",
      "was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with\n",
      "one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head.\n",
      "Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out\n",
      "of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself ‘Now I\n",
      "can do no more, whatever happens. What WILL become of me?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect,\n",
      "and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there\n",
      "seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room\n",
      "again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was much pleasanter at home,’ thought poor Alice, ‘when one wasn’t\n",
      "always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and\n",
      "rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and\n",
      "yet--it’s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what\n",
      "CAN have happened to me! When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!\n",
      "There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I\n",
      "grow up, I’ll write one--but I’m grown up now,’ she added in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more HERE.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But then,’ thought Alice, ‘shall I NEVER get any older than I am\n",
      "now? That’ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn’t like THAT!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, you foolish Alice!’ she answered herself. ‘How can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for YOU, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!’\n",
      "\n",
      "And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Mary Ann! Mary Ann!’ said the voice. ‘Fetch me my gloves this moment!’\n",
      "Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was\n",
      "the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself ‘Then I’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘THAT you won’t’ thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit’s--‘Pat! Pat! Where are you?’ And\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, ‘Sure then I’m here! Digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Digging for apples, indeed!’ said the Rabbit angrily. ‘Here! Come and\n",
      "help me out of THIS!’ (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (He pronounced it ‘arrum.’)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, ‘Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!’ ‘Do as I tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were\n",
      "TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘What a number of\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought Alice. ‘I wonder what they’ll do\n",
      "next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I’m\n",
      "sure I don’t want to stay in here any longer!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: ‘Where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?--Why, I hadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other--Bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--Here, put ‘em up at this corner--No, tie ‘em\n",
      "together first--they don’t reach half high enough yet--Oh! they’ll\n",
      "do well enough; don’t be particular--Here, Bill! catch hold of this\n",
      "rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate--Oh, it’s coming\n",
      "down! Heads below!’ (a loud crash)--‘Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I\n",
      "fancy--Who’s to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan’t! YOU do it!--That I\n",
      "won’t, then!--Bill’s to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you’re to\n",
      "go down the chimney!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?’ said Alice to\n",
      "herself. ‘Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn’t be in\n",
      "Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "I THINK I can kick a little!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself ‘This is Bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",
      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘There goes Bill!’\n",
      "then the Rabbit’s voice along--‘Catch him, you by the hedge!’ then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--‘Hold up his head--Brandy\n",
      "now--Don’t choke him--How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\n",
      "us all about it!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [‘That’s Bill,’ thought\n",
      "Alice,) ‘Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I’m better now--but I’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So you did, old fellow!’ said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We must burn the house down!’ said the Rabbit’s voice; and Alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, ‘If you do. I’ll set Dinah at you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, ‘I\n",
      "wonder what they WILL do next! If they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.’ After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "Alice heard the Rabbit say, ‘A barrowful will do, to begin with.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A barrowful of WHAT?’ thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. ‘I’ll put a stop to this,’\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, ‘You’d better not do that again!’\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. ‘If I eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make\n",
      "SOME change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, I suppose.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The first thing I’ve got to do,’ said Alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ‘Poor little thing!’\n",
      "said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said Alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: ‘I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I\n",
      "suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\n",
      "hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n",

      "The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:\n",
      "at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\n",
      "her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who are YOU?’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, ‘I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know\n",
      "who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you mean by that?’ said the Caterpillar sternly. ‘Explain\n",
      "yourself!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t explain MYSELF, I’m afraid, sir’ said Alice, ‘because I’m not\n",
      "myself, you see.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t see,’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,’ Alice replied very politely,\n",
      "‘for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It isn’t,’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said Alice; ‘but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, I should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not a bit,’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said Alice; ‘all I know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to ME.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You!’ said the Caterpillar contemptuously. ‘Who are YOU?’\n",
      "\n",
      "Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such VERY\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, ‘I think,\n",
      "you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why?’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come back!’ the Caterpillar called after her. ‘I’ve something important\n",
      "to say!’\n",
      "\n",
      "This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Keep your temper,’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is that all?’ said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\n",
      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\n",
      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",
      "arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘So you think\n",
      "you’re changed, do you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I am, sir,’ said Alice; ‘I can’t remember things as I\n",

      "‘It is wrong from beginning to end,’ said the Caterpillar decidedly, and\n",
      "there was silence for some minutes.\n",

      "The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What size do you want to be?’ it asked.\n",
      "\n",

      "itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I’m not used to it!’ pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And\n",

      "offended!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ll get used to it in time,’ said the Caterpillar; and it put the\n",

      "This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In\n",
      "a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\n",
      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",
      "‘One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\n",
      "grow shorter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?’ thought Alice to herself.\n",

      "aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying\n",
      "to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly\n",
      "round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she\n",
      "stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit\n",
      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",
      "the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent\n",
      "blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",
      "lefthand bit.\n",

      "changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\n",
      "were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\n",
      "an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\n",
      "sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What CAN all that green stuff be?’ said Alice. ‘And where HAVE my\n",
      "shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can’t see you?’\n",
      "She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\n",
      "except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she\n",
      "tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her\n",
      "neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had\n",
      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",
      "her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and\n",
      "was beating her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Serpent!’ screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m NOT a serpent!’ said Alice indignantly. ‘Let me alone!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Serpent, I say again!’ repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone,\n",
      "and added with a kind of sob, ‘I’ve tried every way, and nothing seems\n",
      "to suit them!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, and I’ve tried\n",
      "hedges,’ the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; ‘but those\n",
      "serpents! There’s no pleasing them!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\n",
      "saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,’ said the Pigeon;\n",
      "‘but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\n",
      "haven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,’ said Alice, who was beginning to\n",
      "see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,’ continued the\n",
      "Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, ‘and just as I was thinking I\n",
      "should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from\n",
      "the sky! Ugh, Serpent!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I’m NOT a serpent, I tell you!’ said Alice. ‘I’m a--I’m a--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well! WHAT are you?’ said the Pigeon. ‘I can see you’re trying to\n",
      "invent something!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I--I’m a little girl,’ said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A likely story indeed!’ said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. ‘I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE\n",
      "with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; and there’s no use\n",
      "denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next that you never tasted an\n",
      "egg!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,’ said Alice, who was a very truthful\n",
      "child; ‘but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\n",
      "know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t believe it,’ said the Pigeon; ‘but if they do, why then they’re\n",
      "a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘You’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It matters a good deal to ME,’ said Alice hastily; ‘but I’m not looking\n",
      "for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn’t want YOURS: I don’t\n",
      "like them raw.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, be off, then!’ said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. ‘Come, there’s half my plan done\n",
      "now! How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m going\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my right\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that\n",
      "to be done, I wonder?’ As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘Whoever lives\n",
      "there,’ thought Alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them THIS size: why,\n",
      "I should frighten them out of their wits!’ So she began nibbling at the\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",

      "CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. It was opened\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",
      "over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all about,\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, ‘For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen\n",
      "to play croquet.’ The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, ‘From the Queen. An\n",
      "invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the Footman, ‘and that for\n",
      "two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.’ And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please, then,’ said Alice, ‘how am I to get in?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There might be some sense in your knocking,’ the Footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, ‘if we had the door between us. For instance,\n",
      "if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.’\n",
      "He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\n",
      "Alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘But perhaps he can’t help it,’ she\n",
      "said to herself; ‘his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head.\n",
      "But at any rate he might answer questions.--How am I to get in?’ she\n",
      "repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I shall sit here,’ the Footman remarked, ‘till tomorrow--’\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--or next day, maybe,’ the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How am I to get in?’ asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ARE you to get in at all?’ said the Footman. ‘That’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. ‘It’s really\n",
      "dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "It’s enough to drive one crazy!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. ‘I shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what am I to do?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Anything you like,’ said the Footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said Alice desperately: ‘he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!’ And she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ Alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\n",
      "the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please would you tell me,’ said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a Cheshire cat,’ said the Duchess, ‘and that’s why. Pig!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn’t know\n",
      "that cats COULD grin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They all can,’ said the Duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know of any that do,’ Alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You don’t know much,’ said the Duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, PLEASE mind what you’re doing!’ cried Alice, jumping up and down in\n",
      "an agony of terror. ‘Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS nose’; as an unusually\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If everybody minded their own business,’ the Duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it does.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Which would NOT be an advantage,’ said Alice, who felt very glad to get\n",
      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘Just think of\n",
      "what work it would make with the day and night! You see the earth takes\n",
      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Talking of axes,’ said the Duchess, ‘chop off her head!’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: ‘Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is\n",
      "it twelve? I--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, don’t bother ME,’ said the Duchess; ‘I never could abide figures!’\n",
      "And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\n",
      "lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\n",
      "every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘Speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    And beat him when he sneezes:\n",

      "\n",
      "         CHORUS.\n",

      "\n",
      "While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that Alice could hardly hear the words:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘I speak severely to my boy,\n",

      "As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\n",
      "it out into the open air. ‘IF I don’t take this child away with me,’\n",
      "thought Alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?’ She said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "‘Don’t grunt,’ said Alice; ‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to\n",
      "see what was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\n",
      "eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not\n",
      "like the look of the thing at all. ‘But perhaps it was only sobbing,’\n",
      "she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "No, there were no tears. ‘If you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’\n",
      "said Alice, seriously, ‘I’ll have nothing more to do with you. Mind\n",
      "now!’ The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was just beginning to think to herself, ‘Now, what am I to do with\n",
      "this creature when I get it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently,\n",
      "that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could\n",
      "be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\n",
      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\n",
      "it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘If it had grown up,’ she said\n",
      "to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, I think.’ And she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a\n",
      "tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she\n",
      "thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she\n",
      "felt that it ought to be treated with respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Cheshire Puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n",
      "‘Come, it’s pleased so far,’ thought Alice, and she went on. ‘Would you\n",
      "tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,’ said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t much care where--’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,’ Alice added as an explanation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, you’re sure to do that,’ said the Cat, ‘if you only walk long\n",
      "enough.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.\n",
      "‘What sort of people live about here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘In THAT direction,’ the Cat said, waving its right paw round, ‘lives\n",
      "a Hatter: and in THAT direction,’ waving the other paw, ‘lives a March\n",
      "Hare. Visit either you like: they’re both mad.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But I don’t want to go among mad people,’ Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, you can’t help that,’ said the Cat: ‘we’re all mad here. I’m mad.\n",
      "You’re mad.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How do you know I’m mad?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You must be,’ said the Cat, ‘or you wouldn’t have come here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on ‘And how\n",
      "do you know that you’re mad?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘To begin with,’ said the Cat, ‘a dog’s not mad. You grant that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I suppose so,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, then,’ the Cat went on, ‘you see, a dog growls when it’s angry,\n",
      "and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growl when I’m pleased, and\n",
      "wag my tail when I’m angry. Therefore I’m mad.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I call it purring, not growling,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Call it what you like,’ said the Cat. ‘Do you play croquet with the\n",
      "Queen to-day?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I should like it very much,’ said Alice, ‘but I haven’t been invited\n",
      "yet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ll see me there,’ said the Cat, and vanished.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\n",
      "things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\n",
      "it suddenly appeared again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘By-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the Cat. ‘I’d nearly\n",
      "forgotten to ask.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It turned into a pig,’ Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\n",
      "in a natural way.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I thought it would,’ said the Cat, and vanished again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\n",
      "appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\n",
      "which the March Hare was said to live. ‘I’ve seen hatters before,’ she\n",
      "said to herself; ‘the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\n",
      "perhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad--at least not so mad as\n",
      "it was in March.’ As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat\n",
      "again, sitting on a branch of a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you say pig, or fig?’ said the Cat.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I said pig,’ replied Alice; ‘and I wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and\n",
      "vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right,’ said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,\n",
      "beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which\n",
      "remained some time after the rest of it had gone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought Alice; ‘but a grin\n",
      "without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house\n",
      "of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the\n",
      "chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It\n",
      "was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had\n",
      "nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to\n",
      "about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,\n",
      "saying to herself ‘Suppose it should be raving mad after all! I almost\n",

      "CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\n",
      "March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\n",
      "between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\n",
      "cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘Very\n",
      "uncomfortable for the Dormouse,’ thought Alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, I\n",
      "suppose it doesn’t mind.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\n",
      "one corner of it: ‘No room! No room!’ they cried out when they saw Alice\n",
      "coming. ‘There’s PLENTY of room!’ said Alice indignantly, and she sat\n",
      "down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have some wine,’ the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n",
      "‘I don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There isn’t any,’ said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said Alice angrily.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said\n",
      "the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I didn’t know it was YOUR table,’ said Alice; ‘it’s laid for a great\n",
      "many more than three.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Your hair wants cutting,’ said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice\n",
      "for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You should learn not to make personal remarks,’ Alice said with some\n",
      "severity; ‘it’s very rude.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID\n",
      "was, ‘Why is a raven like a writing-desk?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come, we shall have some fun now!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they’ve\n",
      "begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,’ she added aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said the\n",
      "March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Exactly so,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then you should say what you mean,’ the March Hare went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I do,’ Alice hastily replied; ‘at least--at least I mean what I\n",
      "say--that’s the same thing, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not the same thing a bit!’ said the Hatter. ‘You might just as well say\n",
      "that “I see what I eat” is the same thing as “I eat what I see”!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You might just as well say,’ added the March Hare, ‘that “I like what I\n",
      "get” is the same thing as “I get what I like”!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You might just as well say,’ added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\n",
      "talking in his sleep, ‘that “I breathe when I sleep” is the same thing\n",
      "as “I sleep when I breathe”!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It IS the same thing with you,’ said the Hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice\n",
      "thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\n",
      "which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘What day of the month\n",
      "is it?’ he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\n",
      "pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\n",
      "and holding it to his ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice considered a little, and then said ‘The fourth.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Two days wrong!’ sighed the Hatter. ‘I told you butter wouldn’t suit\n",
      "the works!’ he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It was the BEST butter,’ the March Hare meekly replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ the Hatter grumbled:\n",
      "‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",
      "nothing better to say than his first remark, ‘It was the BEST butter,\n",
      "you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. ‘What a\n",
      "funny watch!’ she remarked. ‘It tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\n",
      "tell what o’clock it is!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why should it?’ muttered the Hatter. ‘Does YOUR watch tell you what\n",
      "year it is?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course not,’ Alice replied very readily: ‘but that’s because it\n",
      "stays the same year for such a long time together.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Which is just the case with MINE,’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no\n",
      "sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. ‘I don’t quite\n",
      "understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The Dormouse is asleep again,’ said the Hatter, and he poured a little\n",
      "hot tea upon its nose.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\n",
      "eyes, ‘Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the Hatter said, turning to Alice\n",
      "again.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I give it up,’ Alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nor I,’ said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice sighed wearily. ‘I think you might do something better with the\n",
      "time,’ she said, ‘than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you knew Time as well as I do,’ said the Hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk\n",
      "about wasting IT. It’s HIM.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t know what you mean,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course you don’t!’ the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.\n",
      "‘I dare say you never even spoke to Time!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps not,’ Alice cautiously replied: ‘but I know I have to beat time\n",
      "when I learn music.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! that accounts for it,’ said the Hatter. ‘He won’t stand beating.\n",
      "Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\n",
      "the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a\n",
      "hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\n",
      "time for dinner!’\n",
      "\n",
      "[‘I only wish it was,’ the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That would be grand, certainly,’ said Alice thoughtfully: ‘but then--I\n",
      "shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not at first, perhaps,’ said the Hatter: ‘but you could keep it to\n",
      "half-past one as long as you liked.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Is that the way YOU manage?’ Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘Not I!’ he replied. ‘We\n",
      "quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--’ (pointing\n",
      "with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) ‘--it was at the great concert\n",
      "given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n",
      "\n",
      "     “Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\n",
      "     How I wonder what you’re at!”\n",
      "\n",
      "You know the song, perhaps?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve heard something like it,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It goes on, you know,’ the Hatter continued, ‘in this way:--\n",
      "\n",
      "     “Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "     Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",
      "         Twinkle, twinkle--“’\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep ‘Twinkle,\n",
      "twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--’ and went on so long that they had to pinch\n",
      "it to make it stop.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,’ said the Hatter, ‘when the\n",
      "Queen jumped up and bawled out, “He’s murdering the time! Off with his\n",
      "head!”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How dreadfully savage!’ exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And ever since that,’ the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, ‘he won’t\n",
      "do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clock now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "A bright idea came into Alice’s head. ‘Is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, that’s it,’ said the Hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s always tea-time,\n",
      "and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then you keep moving round, I suppose?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Exactly so,’ said the Hatter: ‘as the things get used up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what happens when you come to the beginning again?’ Alice ventured\n",
      "to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Suppose we change the subject,’ the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n",
      "‘I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m afraid I don’t know one,’ said Alice, rather alarmed at the\n",
      "proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then the Dormouse shall!’ they both cried. ‘Wake up, Dormouse!’ And\n",
      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘I wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: ‘I heard every word you fellows were saying.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tell us a story!’ said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, please do!’ pleaded Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And be quick about it,’ added the Hatter, ‘or you’ll be asleep again\n",
      "before it’s done.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Once upon a time there were three little sisters,’ the Dormouse began\n",
      "in a great hurry; ‘and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\n",
      "they lived at the bottom of a well--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What did they live on?’ said Alice, who always took a great interest in\n",
      "questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They lived on treacle,’ said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\n",
      "two.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They couldn’t have done that, you know,’ Alice gently remarked; ‘they’d\n",
      "have been ill.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So they were,’ said the Dormouse; ‘VERY ill.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\n",
      "living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘But\n",
      "why did they live at the bottom of a well?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Take some more tea,’ the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve had nothing yet,’ Alice replied in an offended tone, ‘so I can’t\n",
      "take more.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You mean you can’t take LESS,’ said the Hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take\n",
      "MORE than nothing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nobody asked YOUR opinion,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who’s making personal remarks now?’ the Hatter asked triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. ‘Why did they live at the bottom of a well?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, ‘It was a treacle-well.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s no such thing!’ Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "Hatter and the March Hare went ‘Sh! sh!’ and the Dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, ‘If you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, please go on!’ Alice said very humbly; ‘I won’t interrupt again. I\n",
      "dare say there may be ONE.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘One, indeed!’ said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\n",
      "go on. ‘And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,\n",

      "‘I want a clean cup,’ interrupted the Hatter: ‘let’s all move one place\n",
      "on.’\n",
      "\n",
      "He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\n",
      "moved into the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took\n",
      "the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\n",

      "from?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the Hatter; ‘so I should\n",

      "‘But they were IN the well,’ Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to\n",

      "‘Of course they were’, said the Dormouse; ‘--well in.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\n",
      "some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They were learning to draw,’ the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",
      "its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of\n",
      "things--everything that begins with an M--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why with an M?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",

      "Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into\n",
      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: ‘--that begins with an M, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\n",
      "things are “much of a muchness”--did you ever see such a thing as a\n",
      "drawing of a muchness?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Really, now you ask me,’ said Alice, very much confused, ‘I don’t\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Then you shouldn’t talk,’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\n",
      "great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\n",
      "neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\n",
      "looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\n",

      "\n",
      "Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door\n",

      "she went.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little\n",

      "led into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she\n",

      "A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\n",
      "growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\n",

      "nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard one of\n",

      "Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘Well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things--’ when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\n",

      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\n",
      "So you see, Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to--’ At this\n",
      "moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out ‘The Queen! The Queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\n",
      "the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\n",
      "with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among\n",
      "them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\n",
      "nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King’s\n",
      "crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\n",
      "procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of\n",
      "a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ So she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the Queen said severely ‘Who is this?’ She said it to the\n",
      "Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Idiot!’ said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",
      "Alice, she went on, ‘What’s your name, child?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,’ said Alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added, to herself, ‘Why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all. I needn’t be afraid of them!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And who are THESE?’ said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\n",
      "were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\n",
      "faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\n",
      "pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\n",
      "courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How should I know?’ said Alice, surprised at her own courage. ‘It’s no\n",

      "\n",
      "The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘Off with her head! Off--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nonsense!’ said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said ‘Consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave ‘Turn them\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Get up!’ said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\n",

      "the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Leave off that!’ screamed the Queen. ‘You make me giddy.’ And then,\n",
      "turning to the rose-tree, she went on, ‘What HAVE you been doing here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘May it please your Majesty,’ said Two, in a very humble tone, going\n",
      "down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I see!’ said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n",
      "‘Off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the\n",
      "soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\n",
      "to Alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You shan’t be beheaded!’ said Alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are their heads off?’ shouted the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!’ the soldiers shouted\n",

      "\n",
      "‘That’s right!’ shouted the Queen. ‘Can you play croquet?’\n",
      "\n",

      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes!’ shouted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come on, then!’ roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. She was\n",
      "walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very,’ said Alice: ‘--where’s the Duchess?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hush! Hush!’ said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘She’s under\n",
      "sentence of execution.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What for?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Did you say “What a pity!”?’ the Rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, I didn’t,’ said Alice: ‘I don’t think it’s at all a pity. I said\n",
      "“What for?”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘She boxed the Queen’s ears--’ the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. ‘Oh, hush!’ the Rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. ‘The Queen will hear you! You see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "Queen said--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Get to your places!’ shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\n",
      "up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\n",
      "her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\n",
      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\n",
      "blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face,\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\n",
      "time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her head!’ about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? They’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one\n",
      "left alive!’\n",
      "\n",
      "She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\n",
      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n",
      "‘It’s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How are you getting on?’ said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘It’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.’ In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was\n",
      "enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t think they play at all fairly,’ Alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak--and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular;\n",
      "at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch I’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How do you like the Queen?’ said the Cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not at all,’ said Alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ Just then she noticed\n",
      "that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "‘--likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who ARE you talking to?’ said the King, going up to Alice, and looking\n",
      "at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,’ said Alice: ‘allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the King: ‘however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’d rather not,’ the Cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t be impertinent,’ said the King, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’\n",
      "He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A cat may look at a king,’ said Alice. ‘I’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but I don’t remember where.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, it must be removed,’ said the King very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the Queen, who was passing at the moment, ‘My dear! I wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n",
      "‘Off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the King eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\n",
      "other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless\n",
      "sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,’ thought Alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.’ So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a\n",
      "large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at HIS time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less\n",
      "than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was this last\n",
      "remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\n",

      "And the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",

      " The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\n",
      "by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely\n",
      "disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down\n",

      "savage when they met in the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When I’M a Duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\n",
      "though), ‘I won’t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL. Soup does very\n",
      "well without--Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’\n",
      "she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\n",
      "rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\n",
      "them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\n",
      "sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so\n",
      "stingy about it, you know--’\n",
      "\n",
      "She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. ‘You’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Perhaps it hasn’t one,’ Alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Tut, tut, child!’ said the Duchess. ‘Everything’s got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.’ And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice’s side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The game’s going on rather better now,’ she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘’Tis so,’ said the Duchess: ‘and the moral of that is--“Oh, ‘tis love,\n",
      "‘tis love, that makes the world go round!”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Somebody said,’ Alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah, well! It means much the same thing,’ said the Duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, ‘and the moral\n",
      "of THAT is--“Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘How fond she is of finding morals in things!’ Alice thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm round your waist,’\n",
      "the Duchess said after a pause: ‘the reason is, that I’m doubtful about\n",
      "the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘HE might bite,’ Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\n",
      "have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very true,’ said the Duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--“Birds of a feather flock together.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Only mustard isn’t a bird,’ Alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Right, as usual,’ said the Duchess: ‘what a clear way you have of\n",
      "putting things!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a mineral, I THINK,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course it is,’ said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that Alice said; ‘there’s a large mustard-mine near here. And\n",
      "the moral of that is--“The more there is of mine, the less there is of\n",
      "yours.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, I know!’ exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n",
      "‘it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but it is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I quite agree with you,’ said the Duchess; ‘and the moral of that\n",
      "is--“Be what you would seem to be”--or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply--“Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\n",
      "than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I think I should understand that better,’ Alice said very politely, ‘if\n",
      "I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it as you say it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,’ the Duchess replied, in\n",
      "a pleased tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,’ said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, don’t talk about trouble!’ said the Duchess. ‘I make you a present\n",
      "of everything I’ve said as yet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A cheap sort of present!’ thought Alice. ‘I’m glad they don’t give\n",
      "birthday presents like that!’ But she did not venture to say it out\n",
      "loud.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Thinking again?’ the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\n",
      "little chin.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ve a right to think,’ said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\n",
      "feel a little worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Just about as much right,’ said the Duchess, ‘as pigs have to fly; and\n",
      "the m--’\n",
      "\n",
      "But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away, even\n",
      "in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm that was linked\n",
      "into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen\n",
      "in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘A fine day, your Majesty!’ the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Now, I give you fair warning,’ shouted the Queen, stamping on the\n",
      "ground as she spoke; ‘either you or your head must be off, and that in\n",
      "about half no time! Take your choice!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Let’s go on with the game,’ the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was\n",
      "too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\n",
      "croquet-ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and were\n",
      "resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried\n",
      "back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would\n",
      "cost them their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with\n",
      "the other players, and shouting ‘Off with his head!’ or ‘Off with her\n",
      "head!’ Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,\n",
      "who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by\n",
      "the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the\n",
      "players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and\n",
      "under sentence of execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, ‘Have\n",
      "you seen the Mock Turtle yet?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No,’ said Alice. ‘I don’t even know what a Mock Turtle is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,’ said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never saw one, or heard of one,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come on, then,’ said the Queen, ‘and he shall tell you his history,’\n",
      "\n",
      "As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice,\n",
      "to the company generally, ‘You are all pardoned.’ ‘Come, THAT’S a good\n",
      "thing!’ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the\n",
      "number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.\n",
      "(IF you don’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) ‘Up, lazy\n",
      "thing!’ said the Queen, ‘and take this young lady to see the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some\n",
      "executions I have ordered’; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with\n",
      "the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on\n",
      "the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go\n",
      "after that savage Queen: so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till\n",
      "she was out of sight: then it chuckled. ‘What fun!’ said the Gryphon,\n",
      "half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What IS the fun?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, SHE,’ said the Gryphon. ‘It’s all her fancy, that: they never\n",
      "executes nobody, you know. Come on!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought Alice, as she went slowly\n",
      "after it: ‘I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!’\n",
      "\n",
      "They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance,\n",
      "sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came\n",
      "nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. She\n",
      "pitied him deeply. ‘What is his sorrow?’ she asked the Gryphon, and the\n",
      "Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ‘It’s all his\n",
      "fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!’\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes\n",
      "full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘This here young lady,’ said the Gryphon, ‘she wants for to know your\n",
      "history, she do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’ll tell it her,’ said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: ‘sit\n",
      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till I’ve finished.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, ‘I don’t see how he can EVEN finish, if he doesn’t begin.’ But\n",
      "she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Once,’ said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘I was a real\n",
      "Turtle.’\n",
      "\n",
      "These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an\n",
      "occasional exclamation of ‘Hjckrrh!’ from the Gryphon, and the constant\n",
      "heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and\n",
      "saying, ‘Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could\n",
      "not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘When we were little,’ the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, ‘we went to school in the\n",
      "sea. The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him Tortoise--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We called him Tortoise because he taught us,’ said the Mock Turtle\n",
      "angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’\n",
      "added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n",
      "Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said\n",
      "to the Mock Turtle, ‘Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day about it!’\n",
      "and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never said I didn’t!’ interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You did,’ said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hold your tongue!’ added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again.\n",
      "The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’VE been to a day-school, too,’ said Alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud\n",
      "as all that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘With extras?’ asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Alice, ‘we learned French and music.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And washing?’ said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Certainly not!’ said Alice indignantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the Mock Turtle in\n",
      "a tone of great relief. ‘Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill,\n",
      "“French, music, AND WASHING--extra.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said Alice; ‘living at the bottom of\n",
      "the sea.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. ‘I\n",
      "only took the regular course.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What was that?’ inquired Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the Mock Turtle\n",
      "replied; ‘and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition,\n",
      "Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never heard of “Uglification,”’ Alice ventured to say. ‘What is it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. ‘What! Never heard of\n",
      "uglifying!’ it exclaimed. ‘You know what to beautify is, I suppose?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes,’ said Alice doubtfully: ‘it means--to--make--anything--prettier.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, then,’ the Gryphon went on, ‘if you don’t know what to uglify is,\n",
      "you ARE a simpleton.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\n",
      "turned to the Mock Turtle, and said ‘What else had you to learn?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, there was Mystery,’ the Mock Turtle replied, counting off\n",
      "the subjects on his flappers, ‘--Mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",
      "that used to come once a week: HE taught us Drawling, Stretching, and\n",
      "Fainting in Coils.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What was THAT like?’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I can’t show it you myself,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘I’m too\n",
      "stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hadn’t time,’ said the Gryphon: ‘I went to the Classics master, though.\n",
      "He was an old crab, HE was.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I never went to him,’ the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: ‘he taught\n",
      "Laughing and Grief, they used to say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘So he did, so he did,’ said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\n",
      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said Alice, in a hurry to\n",
      "change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Ten hours the first day,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘nine the next, and so\n",
      "on.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What a curious plan!’ exclaimed Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the Gryphon remarked:\n",
      "‘because they lessen from day to day.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little\n",
      "before she made her next remark. ‘Then the eleventh day must have been a\n",
      "holiday?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course it was,’ said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And how did you manage on the twelfth?’ Alice went on eagerly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s enough about lessons,’ the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided\n",
      "tone: ‘tell her something about the games now.’\n",

      "CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille\n",
      "\n",
      "The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across\n",
      "his eyes. He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or\n",
      "two sobs choked his voice. ‘Same as if he had a bone in his throat,’\n",
      "said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You may not have lived much under the sea--’ [‘I haven’t,’ said\n",
      "Alice)--‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--’\n",
      "(Alice began to say ‘I once tasted--’ but checked herself hastily, and\n",
      "said ‘No, never’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a\n",
      "Lobster Quadrille is!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, indeed,’ said Alice. ‘What sort of a dance is it?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why,’ said the Gryphon, ‘you first form into a line along the\n",
      "sea-shore--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Two lines!’ cried the Mock Turtle. ‘Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;\n",
      "then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘THAT generally takes some time,’ interrupted the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--you advance twice--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course,’ the Mock Turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then, you know,’ the Mock Turtle went on, ‘you throw the--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The lobsters!’ shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--as far out to sea as you can--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Swim after them!’ screamed the Gryphon.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly\n",
      "about.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Change lobsters again!’ yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\n",
      "jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\n",
      "and quietly, and looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It must be a very pretty dance,’ said Alice timidly.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Would you like to see a little of it?’ said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Very much indeed,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon.\n",
      "‘We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, YOU sing,’ said the Gryphon. ‘I’ve forgotten the words.’\n",
      "\n",
      "So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\n",
      "then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\n",
      "forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\n",
      "and sadly:--\n",
      "\n",
      " ‘“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘The reason is,’ said the Gryphon, ‘that they WOULD go with the lobsters\n",

      "\n",
      "‘Of course not,’ said the Mock Turtle: ‘why, if a fish came to ME, and\n",
      "told me he was going a journey, I should say “With what porpoise?”’\n",

      "the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened\n",
      "their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went\n",
      "on. Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about\n",
      "her repeating ‘YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,’ to the Caterpillar, and the\n",

      "\n",
      "The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they\n",
      "arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little\n",
      "birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was\n",
      "standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard\n",
      "him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,\n",
      "and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court\n",
      "was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,\n",
      "that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--‘I wish they’d get the\n",
      "trial done,’ she thought, ‘and hand round the refreshments!’ But there\n",
      "seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about\n",
      "her, to pass away the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\n",
      "about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\n",
      "the name of nearly everything there. ‘That’s the judge,’ she said to\n",
      "herself, ‘because of his great wig.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\n",
      "wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did\n",
      "not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘And that’s the jury-box,’ thought Alice, ‘and those twelve creatures,’\n",
      "(she was obliged to say ‘creatures,’ you see, because some of them were\n",
      "animals, and some were birds,) ‘I suppose they are the jurors.’ She said\n",
      "this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of\n",
      "it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her\n",
      "age knew the meaning of it at all. However, ‘jury-men’ would have done\n",
      "just as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. ‘What are they\n",
      "doing?’ Alice whispered to the Gryphon. ‘They can’t have anything to put\n",
      "down yet, before the trial’s begun.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘They’re putting down their names,’ the Gryphon whispered in reply, ‘for\n",
      "fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Stupid things!’ Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped\n",
      "hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, ‘Silence in the court!’ and the\n",
      "King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who\n",
      "was talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\n",
      "that all the jurors were writing down ‘stupid things!’ on their slates,\n",
      "and she could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell\n",
      "‘stupid,’ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. ‘A nice\n",
      "muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’s over!’ thought Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\n",
      "could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\n",
      "very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\n",
      "that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\n",
      "at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was\n",
      "obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was\n",
      "of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Herald, read the accusation!’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then\n",
      "unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,\n",
      "      All on a summer day:\n",
      "    The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,\n",
      "      And took them quite away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Consider your verdict,’ the King said to the jury.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Not yet, not yet!’ the Rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘There’s a great\n",
      "deal to come before that!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Call the first witness,’ said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three\n",
      "blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘First witness!’\n",
      "\n",
      "The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one\n",
      "hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘I beg pardon, your\n",
      "Majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing these in: but I hadn’t quite finished\n",
      "my tea when I was sent for.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You ought to have finished,’ said the King. ‘When did you begin?’\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\n",
      "court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. ‘Fourteenth of March, I think it\n",
      "was,’ he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Fifteenth,’ said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Sixteenth,’ added the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Write that down,’ the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\n",
      "wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\n",
      "reduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Take off your hat,’ the King said to the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It isn’t mine,’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Stolen!’ the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a\n",
      "memorandum of the fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I keep them to sell,’ the Hatter added as an explanation; ‘I’ve none of\n",
      "my own. I’m a hatter.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\n",
      "who turned pale and fidgeted.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Give your evidence,’ said the King; ‘and don’t be nervous, or I’ll have\n",
      "you executed on the spot.’\n",
      "\n",
      "This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\n",
      "from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in\n",
      "his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\n",
      "bread-and-butter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\n",
      "her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\n",
      "grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\n",
      "the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as\n",
      "long as there was room for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.’ said the Dormouse, who was sitting\n",
      "next to her. ‘I can hardly breathe.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I can’t help it,’ said Alice very meekly: ‘I’m growing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’ve no right to grow here,’ said the Dormouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Don’t talk nonsense,’ said Alice more boldly: ‘you know you’re growing\n",
      "too.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,’ said the Dormouse: ‘not in that\n",
      "ridiculous fashion.’ And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the\n",
      "other side of the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",
      "of the court, ‘Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!’ on\n",
      "which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Give your evidence,’ the King repeated angrily, ‘or I’ll have you\n",
      "executed, whether you’re nervous or not.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n",
      "‘--and I hadn’t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the\n",
      "bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The twinkling of the what?’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It began with the tea,’ the Hatter replied.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Of course twinkling begins with a T!’ said the King sharply. ‘Do you\n",
      "take me for a dunce? Go on!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’m a poor man,’ the Hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after\n",
      "that--only the March Hare said--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I didn’t!’ the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You did!’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I deny it!’ said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He denies it,’ said the King: ‘leave out that part.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--’ the Hatter went on, looking\n",
      "anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\n",
      "nothing, being fast asleep.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘After that,’ continued the Hatter, ‘I cut some more bread-and-butter--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But what did the Dormouse say?’ one of the jury asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That I can’t remember,’ said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You MUST remember,’ remarked the King, ‘or I’ll have you executed.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\n",
      "down on one knee. ‘I’m a poor man, your Majesty,’ he began.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You’re a very poor speaker,’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\n",
      "the officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\n",
      "explain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\n",
      "up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\n",
      "head first, and then sat upon it.)\n",

      "‘I’m glad I’ve seen that done,’ thought Alice. ‘I’ve so often read\n",
      "in the newspapers, at the end of trials, “There was some attempts\n",

      "‘--and just take his head off outside,’ the Queen added to one of the\n",

      "‘Call the next witness!’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box in\n",

      "‘Here!’ cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how\n",
      "large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such\n",
      "a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt,\n",
      "upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there\n",
      "they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish\n",
      "she had accidentally upset the week before.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, I BEG your pardon!’ she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and\n",
      "began picking them up again as quickly as she could, for the accident of\n",
      "the goldfish kept running in her head, and she had a vague sort of idea\n",
      "that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or\n",
      "they would die.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘The trial cannot proceed,’ said the King in a very grave voice, ‘until\n",
      "all the jurymen are back in their proper places--ALL,’ he repeated with\n",
      "great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she had put\n",
      "the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its\n",
      "tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move. She soon got\n",
      "it out again, and put it right; ‘not that it signifies much,’ she said\n",
      "to herself; ‘I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial\n",
      "one way up as the other.’\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\n",
      "upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\n",
      "them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\n",
      "accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\n",
      "anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\n",
      "court.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What do you know about this business?’ the King said to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing WHATEVER?’ persisted the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nothing whatever,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That’s very important,’ the King said, turning to the jury. They were\n",
      "just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit\n",
      "interrupted: ‘UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,’ he said in a\n",
      "very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘UNimportant, of course, I meant,’ the King hastily said, and went on\n",
      "to himself in an undertone,\n",
      "\n",
      "‘important--unimportant--unimportant--important--’ as if he were trying\n",
      "which word sounded best.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the jury wrote it down ‘important,’ and some ‘unimportant.’\n",
      "Alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n",
      "‘but it doesn’t matter a bit,’ she thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\n",
      "his note-book, cackled out ‘Silence!’ and read out from his book, ‘Rule\n",
      "Forty-two. ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.’\n",
      "\n",
      "Everybody looked at Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I’M not a mile high,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘You are,’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Nearly two miles high,’ added the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,’ said Alice: ‘besides, that’s not a\n",
      "regular rule: you invented it just now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s the oldest rule in the book,’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then it ought to be Number One,’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. ‘Consider your\n",
      "verdict,’ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,’ said the White\n",
      "Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; ‘this paper has just been picked\n",
      "up.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘What’s in it?’ said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I haven’t opened it yet,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘but it seems to be a\n",
      "letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It must have been that,’ said the King, ‘unless it was written to\n",
      "nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who is it directed to?’ said one of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It isn’t directed at all,’ said the White Rabbit; ‘in fact, there’s\n",
      "nothing written on the OUTSIDE.’ He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and\n",
      "added ‘It isn’t a letter, after all: it’s a set of verses.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?’ asked another of the jurymen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, they’re not,’ said the White Rabbit, ‘and that’s the queerest thing\n",
      "about it.’ (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,’ said the King. (The jury\n",
      "all brightened up again.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Please your Majesty,’ said the Knave, ‘I didn’t write it, and they\n",
      "can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at the end.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If you didn’t sign it,’ said the King, ‘that only makes the matter\n",
      "worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you’d have signed your\n",
      "name like an honest man.’\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\n",
      "clever thing the King had said that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘That PROVES his guilt,’ said the Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It proves nothing of the sort!’ said Alice. ‘Why, you don’t even know\n",
      "what they’re about!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Read them,’ said the King.\n",
      "\n",
      "The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. ‘Where shall I begin, please\n",
      "your Majesty?’ he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Begin at the beginning,’ the King said gravely, ‘and go on till you\n",
      "come to the end: then stop.’\n",
      "\n",
      "These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--\n",
      "\n",

      "   She gave me a good character,\n",
      "    But said I could not swim.\n",
      "\n",
      "   He sent them word I had not gone\n",
      "    (We know it to be true):\n",

      "    What would become of you?\n",
      "\n",
      "   I gave her one, they gave him two,\n",
      "    You gave us three or more;\n",

      "    Though they were mine before.\n",
      "\n",
      "   If I or she should chance to be\n",
      "    Involved in this affair,\n",
      "   He trusts to you to set them free,\n",
      "    Exactly as we were.\n",
      "\n",
      "   My notion was that you had been\n",
      "    (Before she had this fit)\n",
      "   An obstacle that came between\n",
      "    Him, and ourselves, and it.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Don’t let him know she liked them best,\n",
      "    For this must ever be\n",

      "    Between yourself and me.’\n",

      "‘That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet,’ said the\n",
      "King, rubbing his hands; ‘so now let the jury--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If any one of them can explain it,’ said Alice, (she had grown so large\n",
      "in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid of interrupting\n",
      "him,) ‘I’ll give him sixpence. _I_ don’t believe there’s an atom of\n",
      "meaning in it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "The jury all wrote down on their slates, ‘SHE doesn’t believe there’s an\n",
      "atom of meaning in it,’ but none of them attempted to explain the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘If there’s no meaning in it,’ said the King, ‘that saves a world of\n",
      "trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. And yet I don’t know,’\n",
      "he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them\n",
      "with one eye; ‘I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. “--SAID\n",
      "I COULD NOT SWIM--” you can’t swim, can you?’ he added, turning to the\n",
      "Knave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Knave shook his head sadly. ‘Do I look like it?’ he said. (Which he\n",
      "certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘All right, so far,’ said the King, and he went on muttering over\n",
      "the verses to himself: ‘“WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--” that’s the jury, of\n",
      "course--“I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--” why, that must be what he\n",
      "did with the tarts, you know--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘But, it goes on “THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,”’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Why, there they are!’ said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts\n",
      "on the table. ‘Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--“BEFORE SHE\n",
      "HAD THIS FIT--” you never had fits, my dear, I think?’ he said to the\n",
      "Queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Never!’ said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\n",
      "as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\n",
      "slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\n",
      "began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as\n",
      "it lasted.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Then the words don’t FIT you,’ said the King, looking round the court\n",
      "with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘It’s a pun!’ the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed,\n",
      "‘Let the jury consider their verdict,’ the King said, for about the\n",
      "twentieth time that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘No, no!’ said the Queen. ‘Sentence first--verdict afterwards.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Stuff and nonsense!’ said Alice loudly. ‘The idea of having the\n",
      "sentence first!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Hold your tongue!’ said the Queen, turning purple.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘I won’t!’ said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Off with her head!’ the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\n",
      "moved.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Who cares for you?’ said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this\n",
      "time.) ‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’\n",
      "\n",
      "At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\n",
      "her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\n",
      "tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\n",
      "head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\n",
      "leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Wake up, Alice dear!’ said her sister; ‘Why, what a long sleep you’ve\n",
      "had!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!’ said Alice, and she told her\n",
      "sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures\n",
      "of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had\n",
      "finished, her sister kissed her, and said, ‘It WAS a curious dream,\n",
      "dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.’ So\n",
      "Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\n",
      "what a wonderful dream it had been.\n",
      "\n",
      "But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\n",
      "hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her\n",
      "wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and\n",
      "this was her dream:--\n",
      "\n",
      "First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny\n",
      "hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking\n",
      "up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that\n",
      "queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that\n",
      "WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to\n",
      "listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures\n",
      "of her little sister’s dream.\n",
      "\n",
      "The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the\n",
      "frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she\n",
      "could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends\n",
      "shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen\n",
      "ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby\n",
      "was sneezing on the Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed\n",
      "around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the\n",
      "Lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,\n",
      "filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock\n",
      "Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in\n",
      "Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all\n",
      "would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the\n",
      "wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling\n",
      "teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill\n",
      "cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the\n",
      "shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she\n",
      "knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing\n",
      "of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s\n",
      "heavy sobs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers\n",
      "would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would\n",
      "keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her\n",
      "childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and\n",
      "make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even\n",
      "with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with\n",
      "all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,\n",
      "remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.\n",

      "turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found\n",

      "there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when\n",

      "\n",
      "suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid\n",
      "glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and alice’s\n",
      "first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;\n",
      "but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,\n",
      "but at any rate it would not open any of them. however, on the second\n",
      "time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and\n",
      "behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the\n",
      "little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not\n",
      "much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage\n",
      "into the loveliest garden you ever saw. how she longed to get out of\n",
      "that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and\n",
      "those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the\n",
      "doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor alice, ‘it\n",

      "there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went\n",

      "\n",
      "it was all very well to say ‘drink me,’ but the wise little alice was\n",

      "know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! and it’ll fetch things when\n",

      "away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in\n",
      "the pool as it went.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she called softly after it, ‘mouse dear! do come back again, and we\n",

      "the first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a\n",

      "can have happened to me! when i used to read fairy-tales, i fancied that\n",
      "kind of thing never happened, and now here i am in the middle of one!\n",
      "there ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! and when i\n",
      "grow up, i’ll write one--but i’m grown up now,’ she added in a sorrowful\n",
      "tone; ‘at least there’s no room to grow up any more here.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘but then,’ thought alice, ‘shall i never get any older than i am\n",
      "now? that’ll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but\n",
      "then--always to have lessons to learn! oh, i shouldn’t like that!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh, you foolish alice!’ she answered herself. ‘how can you learn\n",
      "lessons in here? why, there’s hardly room for you, and no room at all\n",
      "for any lesson-books!’\n",
      "\n",
      "and so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making\n",
      "quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard\n",
      "a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘mary ann! mary ann!’ said the voice. ‘fetch me my gloves this moment!’\n",
      "then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. alice knew it was\n",
      "the rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\n",
      "house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large\n",
      "as the rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "presently the rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\n",
      "the door opened inwards, and alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it,\n",
      "that attempt proved a failure. alice heard it say to itself ‘then i’ll\n",
      "go round and get in at the window.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘that you won’t’ thought alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\n",
      "she heard the rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\n",
      "hand, and made a snatch in the air. she did not get hold of anything,\n",
      "but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\n",
      "from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\n",
      "cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "next came an angry voice--the rabbit’s--‘pat! pat! where are you?’ and\n",
      "then a voice she had never heard before, ‘sure then i’m here! digging\n",
      "for apples, yer honour!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘digging for apples, indeed!’ said the rabbit angrily. ‘here! come and\n",
      "help me out of this!’ (sounds of more broken glass.)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘now tell me, pat, what’s that in the window?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!’ (he pronounced it ‘arrum.’)\n",
      "\n",
      "‘an arm, you goose! who ever saw one that size? why, it fills the whole\n",
      "window!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!’\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a long silence after this, and alice could only hear whispers\n",
      "now and then; such as, ‘sure, i don’t like it, yer honour, at all, at\n",
      "all!’ ‘do as i tell you, you coward!’ and at last she spread out her\n",
      "hand again, and made another snatch in the air. this time there were\n",
      "two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. ‘what a number of\n",
      "cucumber-frames there must be!’ thought alice. ‘i wonder what they’ll do\n",
      "next! as for pulling me out of the window, i only wish they could! i’m\n",
      "sure i don’t want to stay in here any longer!’\n",
      "\n",
      "she waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a\n",
      "rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices\n",
      "all talking together: she made out the words: ‘where’s the other\n",
      "ladder?--why, i hadn’t to bring but one; bill’s got the other--bill!\n",
      "fetch it here, lad!--here, put ‘em up at this corner--no, tie ‘em\n",

      "won’t, then!--bill’s to go down--here, bill! the master says you’re to\n",
      "go down the chimney!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh! so bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?’ said alice to\n",
      "herself. ‘shy, they seem to put everything upon bill! i wouldn’t be in\n",
      "bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\n",
      "i think i can kick a little!’\n",
      "\n",
      "she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited\n",
      "till she heard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was)\n",
      "scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\n",
      "saying to herself ‘this is bill,’ she gave one sharp kick, and waited to\n",
      "see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "the first thing she heard was a general chorus of ‘there goes bill!’\n",
      "then the rabbit’s voice along--‘catch him, you by the hedge!’ then\n",
      "silence, and then another confusion of voices--‘hold up his head--brandy\n",
      "now--don’t choke him--how was it, old fellow? what happened to you? tell\n",
      "us all about it!’\n",
      "\n",
      "last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, [‘that’s bill,’ thought\n",
      "alice,) ‘well, i hardly know--no more, thank ye; i’m better now--but i’m\n",
      "a deal too flustered to tell you--all i know is, something comes at me\n",
      "like a jack-in-the-box, and up i goes like a sky-rocket!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘so you did, old fellow!’ said the others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘we must burn the house down!’ said the rabbit’s voice; and alice called\n",
      "out as loud as she could, ‘if you do. i’ll set dinah at you!’\n",
      "\n",
      "there was a dead silence instantly, and alice thought to herself, ‘i\n",
      "wonder what they will do next! if they had any sense, they’d take the\n",
      "roof off.’ after a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\n",
      "alice heard the rabbit say, ‘a barrowful will do, to begin with.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘a barrowful of what?’ thought alice; but she had not long to doubt,\n",
      "for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\n",
      "window, and some of them hit her in the face. ‘i’ll put a stop to this,’\n",
      "she said to herself, and shouted out, ‘you’d better not do that again!’\n",
      "which produced another dead silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\n",
      "little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\n",
      "head. ‘if i eat one of these cakes,’ she thought, ‘it’s sure to make\n",
      "some change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger, it must\n",
      "make me smaller, i suppose.’\n",
      "\n",
      "so she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\n",
      "began shrinking directly. as soon as she was small enough to get through\n",
      "the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little\n",
      "animals and birds waiting outside. the poor little lizard, bill, was\n",
      "in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\n",
      "something out of a bottle. they all made a rush at alice the moment she\n",
      "appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\n",
      "safe in a thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘the first thing i’ve got to do,’ said alice to herself, as she wandered\n",
      "about in the wood, ‘is to grow to my right size again; and the second\n",
      "thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. i think that will be\n",
      "the best plan.’\n",
      "\n",
      "it sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply\n",
      "arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea\n",
      "how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among\n",
      "the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a\n",
      "great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and\n",
      "feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. ‘poor little thing!’\n",
      "said alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but\n",
      "she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be\n",
      "hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of\n",
      "all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and\n",
      "held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off\n",
      "all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick,\n",
      "and made believe to worry it; then alice dodged behind a great thistle,\n",
      "to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the\n",
      "other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head\n",
      "over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then alice, thinking it was\n",
      "very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then\n",
      "the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very\n",
      "little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely\n",
      "all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with\n",
      "its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she\n",
      "set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and\n",
      "till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and yet what a dear little puppy it was!’ said alice, as she leant\n",
      "against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the\n",
      "leaves: ‘i should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if i’d\n",
      "only been the right size to do it! oh dear! i’d nearly forgotten that\n",
      "i’ve got to grow up again! let me see--how is it to be managed? i\n",
      "suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great\n",
      "question is, what?’\n",
      "\n",
      "the great question certainly was, what? alice looked all round her at\n",
      "the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\n",
      "looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\n",
      "there was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\n",
      "herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\n",
      "behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\n",
      "was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "she stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\n",
      "mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar,\n",
      "that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long\n",
      "hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.\n",

      "the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence:\n",
      "at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed\n",
      "her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘who are you?’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. alice replied,\n",
      "rather shyly, ‘i--i hardly know, sir, just at present--at least i know\n",
      "who i was when i got up this morning, but i think i must have been\n",
      "changed several times since then.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘what do you mean by that?’ said the caterpillar sternly. ‘explain\n",
      "yourself!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i can’t explain myself, i’m afraid, sir’ said alice, ‘because i’m not\n",
      "myself, you see.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i don’t see,’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i’m afraid i can’t put it more clearly,’ alice replied very politely,\n",
      "‘for i can’t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\n",
      "different sizes in a day is very confusing.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it isn’t,’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,’ said alice; ‘but when you\n",
      "have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then\n",
      "after that into a butterfly, i should think you’ll feel it a little\n",
      "queer, won’t you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘not a bit,’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, perhaps your feelings may be different,’ said alice; ‘all i know\n",
      "is, it would feel very queer to me.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you!’ said the caterpillar contemptuously. ‘who are you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\n",
      "alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar’s making such very\n",
      "short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, ‘i think,\n",
      "you ought to tell me who you are, first.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘why?’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "here was another puzzling question; and as alice could not think of any\n",
      "good reason, and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant\n",
      "state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘come back!’ the caterpillar called after her. ‘i’ve something important\n",
      "to say!’\n",
      "\n",
      "this sounded promising, certainly: alice turned and came back again.\n",
      "\n",

      "could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘no,’ said the caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and\n",
      "perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. for some\n",
      "minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its\n",
      "arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, ‘so you think\n",
      "you’re changed, do you?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i’m afraid i am, sir,’ said alice; ‘i can’t remember things as i\n",

      "\n",
      "‘can’t remember what things?’ said the caterpillar.\n",

      "    why, i do it again and again.’\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘you are old,’ said the youth, ‘as i mentioned before,\n",

      "a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth\n",

      "mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n",

      "of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and now which is which?’ she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\n",

      "\n",
      "she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\n",
      "that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\n",
      "set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. her chin was pressed\n",
      "so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\n",
      "mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\n",

      "just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going\n",
      "to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops\n",
      "of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made\n",

      "\n",
      "‘i--i’m a little girl,’ said alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\n",
      "the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘a likely story indeed!’ said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest\n",
      "contempt. ‘i’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one\n",
      "with such a neck as that! no, no! you’re a serpent; and there’s no use\n",

      "\n",

      "a kind of serpent, that’s all i can say.’\n",
      "\n",
      "this was such a new idea to alice, that she was quite silent for a\n",
      "minute or two, which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding, ‘you’re\n",
      "looking for eggs, i know that well enough; and what does it matter to me\n",
      "whether you’re a little girl or a serpent?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it matters a good deal to me,’ said alice hastily; ‘but i’m not looking\n",

      "like them raw.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, be off, then!’ said the pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\n",
      "down again into its nest. alice crouched down among the trees as well as\n",
      "she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and\n",
      "every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. after a while she\n",
      "remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and\n",
      "she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the\n",
      "other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "it was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\n",
      "felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\n",
      "and began talking to herself, as usual. ‘come, there’s half my plan done\n",
      "now! how puzzling all these changes are! i’m never sure what i’m going\n",
      "to be, from one minute to another! however, i’ve got back to my right\n",
      "size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how is that\n",
      "to be done, i wonder?’ as she said this, she came suddenly upon an open\n",
      "place, with a little house in it about four feet high. ‘whoever lives\n",
      "there,’ thought alice, ‘it’ll never do to come upon them this size: why,\n",
      "i should frighten them out of their wits!’ so she began nibbling at the\n",
      "righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she\n",
      "had brought herself down to nine inches high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "chapter vi. pig and pepper\n",
      "\n",
      "for a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and wondering what\n",
      "to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the\n",
      "wood--(she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery:\n",
      "otherwise, judging by his face only, she would have called him a\n",
      "fish)--and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles. it was opened\n",
      "by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\n",
      "frog; and both footmen, alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all\n",
      "over their heads. she felt very curious to know what it was all about,\n",
      "and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\n",
      "\n",
      "the fish-footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\n",
      "nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\n",
      "saying, in a solemn tone, ‘for the duchess. an invitation from the queen\n",
      "to play croquet.’ the frog-footman repeated, in the same solemn tone,\n",
      "only changing the order of the words a little, ‘from the queen. an\n",
      "invitation for the duchess to play croquet.’\n",
      "\n",
      "then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the\n",
      "wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\n",
      "fish-footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\n",
      "door, staring stupidly up into the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘there’s no sort of use in knocking,’ said the footman, ‘and that for\n",
      "two reasons. first, because i’m on the same side of the door as you\n",
      "are; secondly, because they’re making such a noise inside, no one could\n",
      "possibly hear you.’ and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise\n",
      "going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then\n",
      "a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘please, then,’ said alice, ‘how am i to get in?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘there might be some sense in your knocking,’ the footman went on\n",
      "without attending to her, ‘if we had the door between us. for instance,\n",
      "if you were inside, you might knock, and i could let you out, you know.’\n",
      "he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and this\n",
      "alice thought decidedly uncivil. ‘but perhaps he can’t help it,’ she\n",
      "said to herself; ‘his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head.\n",
      "but at any rate he might answer questions.--how am i to get in?’ she\n",
      "repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i shall sit here,’ the footman remarked, ‘till tomorrow--’\n",
      "\n",
      "at this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\n",
      "skimming out, straight at the footman’s head: it just grazed his nose,\n",
      "and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘--or next day, maybe,’ the footman continued in the same tone, exactly\n",
      "as if nothing had happened.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how am i to get in?’ asked alice again, in a louder tone.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘are you to get in at all?’ said the footman. ‘that’s the first\n",
      "question, you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "it was, no doubt: only alice did not like to be told so. ‘it’s really\n",
      "dreadful,’ she muttered to herself, ‘the way all the creatures argue.\n",
      "it’s enough to drive one crazy!’\n",
      "\n",
      "the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\n",
      "remark, with variations. ‘i shall sit here,’ he said, ‘on and off, for\n",
      "days and days.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘but what am i to do?’ said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘anything you like,’ said the footman, and began whistling.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh, there’s no use in talking to him,’ said alice desperately: ‘he’s\n",
      "perfectly idiotic!’ and she opened the door and went in.\n",
      "\n",
      "the door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from\n",
      "one end to the other: the duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in\n",
      "the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring\n",
      "a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘there’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!’ alice said to herself,\n",
      "as well as she could for sneezing.\n",
      "\n",
      "there was certainly too much of it in the air. even the duchess\n",
      "sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\n",
      "alternately without a moment’s pause. the only things in the kitchen\n",
      "that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on\n",
      "the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘please would you tell me,’ said alice, a little timidly, for she was\n",
      "not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, ‘why\n",
      "your cat grins like that?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it’s a cheshire cat,’ said the duchess, ‘and that’s why. pig!’\n",
      "\n",
      "she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite\n",
      "jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby,\n",
      "and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i didn’t know that cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, i didn’t know\n",
      "that cats could grin.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘they all can,’ said the duchess; ‘and most of ‘em do.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i don’t know of any that do,’ alice said very politely, feeling quite\n",
      "pleased to have got into a conversation.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you don’t know much,’ said the duchess; ‘and that’s a fact.’\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\n",
      "be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. while she\n",
      "was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\n",
      "fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\n",
      "the duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a\n",
      "shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. the duchess took no notice of\n",
      "them even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\n",
      "that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh, please mind what you’re doing!’ cried alice, jumping up and down in\n",
      "an agony of terror. ‘oh, there goes his precious nose’; as an unusually\n",
      "large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘if everybody minded their own business,’ the duchess said in a hoarse\n",
      "growl, ‘the world would go round a deal faster than it does.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘which would not be an advantage,’ said alice, who felt very glad to get\n",
      "an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. ‘just think of\n",
      "what work it would make with the day and night! you see the earth takes\n",
      "twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘talking of axes,’ said the duchess, ‘chop off her head!’\n",
      "\n",
      "alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\n",
      "the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\n",
      "be listening, so she went on again: ‘twenty-four hours, i think; or is\n",
      "it twelve? i--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh, don’t bother me,’ said the duchess; ‘i never could abide figures!’\n",
      "and with that she began nursing her child again, singing a sort of\n",
      "lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of\n",
      "every line:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘speak roughly to your little boy,\n",
      "    and beat him when he sneezes:\n",
      "   he only does it to annoy,\n",
      "    because he knows it teases.’\n",
      "\n",
      "         chorus.\n",
      "\n",
      " (in which the cook and the baby joined):--\n",
      "\n",
      "       ‘wow! wow! wow!’\n",
      "\n",
      "while the duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\n",
      "the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\n",
      "that alice could hardly hear the words:--\n",
      "\n",
      "   ‘i speak severely to my boy,\n",
      "    i beat him when he sneezes;\n",
      "   for he can thoroughly enjoy\n",
      "    the pepper when he pleases!’\n",

      "         chorus.\n",

      "       ‘wow! wow! wow!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!’ the duchess said to alice,\n",
      "flinging the baby at her as she spoke. ‘i must go and get ready to play\n",
      "croquet with the queen,’ and she hurried out of the room. the cook threw\n",
      "a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped\n",
      "little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, ‘just\n",
      "like a star-fish,’ thought alice. the poor little thing was snorting\n",
      "like a steam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and\n",
      "straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute\n",
      "or two, it was as much as she could do to hold it.\n",
      "\n",
      "as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to\n",
      "twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right\n",
      "ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried\n",
      "it out into the open air. ‘if i don’t take this child away with me,’\n",
      "thought alice, ‘they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t it be\n",
      "murder to leave it behind?’ she said the last words out loud, and the\n",
      "little thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).\n",
      "‘don’t grunt,’ said alice; ‘that’s not at all a proper way of expressing\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "the baby grunted again, and alice looked very anxiously into its face to\n",
      "see what was the matter with it. there could be no doubt that it had\n",
      "a very turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its\n",
      "eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether alice did not\n",
      "like the look of the thing at all. ‘but perhaps it was only sobbing,’\n",
      "she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any\n",
      "tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "no, there were no tears. ‘if you’re going to turn into a pig, my dear,’\n",
      "said alice, seriously, ‘i’ll have nothing more to do with you. mind\n",
      "now!’ the poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\n",
      "to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was just beginning to think to herself, ‘now, what am i to do with\n",
      "this creature when i get it home?’ when it grunted again, so violently,\n",
      "that she looked down into its face in some alarm. this time there could\n",
      "be no mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she\n",
      "felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.\n",
      "\n",
      "so she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see\n",
      "it trot away quietly into the wood. ‘if it had grown up,’ she said\n",
      "to herself, ‘it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\n",
      "rather a handsome pig, i think.’ and she began thinking over other\n",
      "children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying\n",
      "to herself, ‘if one only knew the right way to change them--’ when she\n",
      "was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a\n",
      "tree a few yards off.\n",
      "\n",
      "the cat only grinned when it saw alice. it looked good-natured, she\n",

      "\n",
      "‘cheshire puss,’ she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know\n",
      "whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘then it doesn’t matter which way you go,’ said the cat.\n",

      "it was in march.’ as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat\n",

      "‘not the same thing a bit!’ said the hatter. ‘you might just as well say\n",

      "as “i sleep when i breathe”!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it is the same thing with you,’ said the hatter, and here the\n",
      "conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while alice\n",
      "thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,\n",
      "which wasn’t much.\n",
      "\n",
      "the hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘what day of the month\n",

      "\n",
      "alice considered a little, and then said ‘the fourth.’\n",

      "\n",
      "‘it was the best butter,’ the march hare meekly replied.\n",

      "\n",
      "the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\n",
      "it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\n",

      "you know.’\n",
      "\n",
      "alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. ‘what a\n",
      "funny watch!’ she remarked. ‘it tells the day of the month, and doesn’t\n",

      "\n",
      "‘which is just the case with mine,’ said the hatter.\n",

      "understand you,’ she said, as politely as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘the dormouse is asleep again,’ said the hatter, and he poured a little\n",

      "\n",
      "‘nor i,’ said the march hare.\n",

      "\n",

      "now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything\n",
      "you liked with the clock. for instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in\n",

      "\n",
      "‘is that the way you manage?’ alice asked.\n",

      "         twinkle, twinkle--“’\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "do a thing i ask! it’s always six o’clock now.’\n",
      "\n",
      "a bright idea came into alice’s head. ‘is that the reason so many\n",
      "tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘yes, that’s it,’ said the hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s always tea-time,\n",

      "they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘i wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a\n",
      "hoarse, feeble voice: ‘i heard every word you fellows were saying.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘tell us a story!’ said the march hare.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself\n",
      "to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and\n",
      "repeated her question. ‘why did they live at the bottom of a well?’\n",
      "\n",
      "the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\n",
      "said, ‘it was a treacle-well.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘there’s no such thing!’ alice was beginning very angrily, but the\n",
      "hatter and the march hare went ‘sh! sh!’ and the dormouse sulkily\n",
      "remarked, ‘if you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for\n",
      "yourself.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘no, please go on!’ alice said very humbly; ‘i won’t interrupt again. i\n",

      "\n",
      "‘one, indeed!’ said the dormouse indignantly. however, he consented to\n",

      "you know--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘what did they draw?’ said alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",

      "on.’\n",
      "\n",
      "he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the march hare\n",
      "moved into the dormouse’s place, and alice rather unwillingly took\n",
      "the place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any\n",
      "advantage from the change: and alice was a good deal worse off than\n",
      "before, as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very\n",

      "from?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the hatter; ‘so i should\n",

      "\n",
      "‘but they were in the well,’ alice said to the dormouse, not choosing to\n",
      "notice this last remark.\n",

      "\n",
      "‘they were learning to draw,’ the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\n",

      "\n",

      "a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with\n",
      "a little shriek, and went on: ‘--that begins with an m, such as\n",
      "mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say\n",

      "‘what for?’ said the one who had spoken first.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘that’s none of your business, two!’ said seven.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘yes, it is his business!’ said five, ‘and i’ll tell him--it was for\n",

      "\n",
      "seven flung down his brush, and had just begun ‘well, of all the unjust\n",
      "things--’ when his eye chanced to fall upon alice, as she stood watching\n",
      "them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also, and\n",
      "all of them bowed low.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘would you tell me,’ said alice, a little timidly, ‘why you are painting\n",
      "those roses?’\n",
      "\n",
      "five and seven said nothing, but looked at two. two began in a low\n",
      "voice, ‘why the fact is, you see, miss, this here ought to have been a\n",
      "red rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the queen\n",
      "was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.\n",
      "so you see, miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to--’ at this\n",
      "moment five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\n",
      "out ‘the queen! the queen!’ and the three gardeners instantly threw\n",
      "themselves flat upon their faces. there was a sound of many footsteps,\n",
      "and alice looked round, eager to see the queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "first came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like\n",
      "the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\n",
      "corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\n",
      "diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came\n",
      "the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\n",
      "jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented\n",
      "with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among\n",
      "them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried\n",
      "nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king’s\n",
      "crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand\n",
      "procession, came the king and queen of hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\n",
      "like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\n",
      "of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of\n",
      "a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their\n",
      "faces, so that they couldn’t see it?’ so she stood still where she was,\n",
      "and waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "when the procession came opposite to alice, they all stopped and looked\n",
      "at her, and the queen said severely ‘who is this?’ she said it to the\n",
      "knave of hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘idiot!’ said the queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\n",
      "alice, she went on, ‘what’s your name, child?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘my name is alice, so please your majesty,’ said alice very politely;\n",
      "but she added, to herself, ‘why, they’re only a pack of cards, after\n",
      "all. i needn’t be afraid of them!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and who are these?’ said the queen, pointing to the three gardeners who\n",
      "were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their\n",
      "faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the\n",
      "pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or\n",
      "courtiers, or three of her own children.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how should i know?’ said alice, surprised at her own courage. ‘it’s no\n",
      "business of mine.’\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\n",
      "moment like a wild beast, screamed ‘off with her head! off--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘nonsense!’ said alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the queen was\n",
      "silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "the king laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said ‘consider, my\n",
      "dear: she is only a child!’\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the knave ‘turn them\n",

      "\n",
      "the knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘get up!’ said the queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\n",
      "gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the king, the queen,\n",
      "the royal children, and everybody else.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘leave off that!’ screamed the queen. ‘you make me giddy.’ and then,\n",
      "turning to the rose-tree, she went on, ‘what have you been doing here?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘may it please your majesty,’ said two, in a very humble tone, going\n",
      "down on one knee as he spoke, ‘we were trying--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i see!’ said the queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n",
      "‘off with their heads!’ and the procession moved on, three of the\n",
      "soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\n",
      "to alice for protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you shan’t be beheaded!’ said alice, and she put them into a large\n",
      "flower-pot that stood near. the three soldiers wandered about for a\n",
      "minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘are their heads off?’ shouted the queen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘their heads are gone, if it please your majesty!’ the soldiers shouted\n",
      "in reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘that’s right!’ shouted the queen. ‘can you play croquet?’\n",
      "\n",
      "the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was\n",
      "evidently meant for her.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘yes!’ shouted alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘come on, then!’ roared the queen, and alice joined the procession,\n",
      "wondering very much what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it’s--it’s a very fine day!’ said a timid voice at her side. she was\n",
      "walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘very,’ said alice: ‘--where’s the duchess?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘hush! hush!’ said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he looked\n",
      "anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon\n",
      "tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered ‘she’s under\n",
      "sentence of execution.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘what for?’ said alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘did you say “what a pity!”?’ the rabbit asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘no, i didn’t,’ said alice: ‘i don’t think it’s at all a pity. i said\n",
      "“what for?”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘she boxed the queen’s ears--’ the rabbit began. alice gave a little\n",
      "scream of laughter. ‘oh, hush!’ the rabbit whispered in a frightened\n",
      "tone. ‘the queen will hear you! you see, she came rather late, and the\n",
      "queen said--’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘get to your places!’ shouted the queen in a voice of thunder, and\n",
      "people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each\n",
      "other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game\n",
      "began. alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in\n",
      "her life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs,\n",
      "the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves\n",
      "up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo:\n",
      "she succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under\n",
      "her arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got\n",
      "its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a\n",
      "blow with its head, it would twist itself round and look up in her face,\n",
      "with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out\n",
      "laughing: and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin\n",
      "again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was\n",
      "generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the\n",
      "hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up\n",
      "and walking off to other parts of the ground, alice soon came to the\n",
      "conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "the players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling\n",
      "all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short\n",
      "time the queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and\n",
      "shouting ‘off with his head!’ or ‘off with her head!’ about once in a\n",
      "minute.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any\n",
      "dispute with the queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute,\n",
      "‘and then,’ thought she, ‘what would become of me? they’re dreadfully\n",
      "fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there’s any one\n",
      "left alive!’\n",
      "\n",
      "she was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\n",
      "could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance\n",
      "in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it\n",
      "a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself\n",
      "‘it’s the cheshire cat: now i shall have somebody to talk to.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how are you getting on?’ said the cat, as soon as there was mouth\n",
      "enough for it to speak with.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. ‘it’s no use\n",
      "speaking to it,’ she thought, ‘till its ears have come, or at least one\n",
      "of them.’ in another minute the whole head appeared, and then alice put\n",
      "down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\n",
      "she had someone to listen to her. the cat seemed to think that there was\n",
      "enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i don’t think they play at all fairly,’ alice began, in rather a\n",
      "complaining tone, ‘and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can’t hear\n",
      "oneself speak--and they don’t seem to have any rules in particular;\n",
      "at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you’ve no idea how\n",
      "confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there’s the\n",
      "arch i’ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\n",
      "ground--and i should have croqueted the queen’s hedgehog just now, only\n",
      "it ran away when it saw mine coming!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how do you like the queen?’ said the cat in a low voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘not at all,’ said alice: ‘she’s so extremely--’ just then she noticed\n",
      "that the queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n",
      "‘--likely to win, that it’s hardly worth while finishing the game.’\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘who are you talking to?’ said the king, going up to alice, and looking\n",
      "at the cat’s head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it’s a friend of mine--a cheshire cat,’ said alice: ‘allow me to\n",
      "introduce it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i don’t like the look of it at all,’ said the king: ‘however, it may\n",
      "kiss my hand if it likes.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i’d rather not,’ the cat remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘don’t be impertinent,’ said the king, ‘and don’t look at me like that!’\n",
      "he got behind alice as he spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘a cat may look at a king,’ said alice. ‘i’ve read that in some book,\n",
      "but i don’t remember where.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, it must be removed,’ said the king very decidedly, and he called\n",
      "the queen, who was passing at the moment, ‘my dear! i wish you would\n",
      "have this cat removed!’\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.\n",
      "‘off with his head!’ she said, without even looking round.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i’ll fetch the executioner myself,’ said the king eagerly, and he\n",
      "hurried off.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\n",
      "on, as she heard the queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with\n",
      "passion. she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\n",
      "executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\n",
      "of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\n",
      "whether it was her turn or not. so she went in search of her hedgehog.\n",
      "\n",
      "the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\n",
      "to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\n",
      "other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the\n",
      "other side of the garden, where alice could see it trying in a helpless\n",
      "sort of way to fly up into a tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\n",
      "was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: ‘but it doesn’t\n",
      "matter much,’ thought alice, ‘as all the arches are gone from this side\n",
      "of the ground.’ so she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\n",
      "escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\n",
      "friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "when she got back to the cheshire cat, she was surprised to find quite a\n",
      "large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\n",
      "the executioner, the king, and the queen, who were all talking at once,\n",
      "while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\n",
      "\n",
      "the moment alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\n",
      "the question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\n",
      "all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\n",
      "what they said.\n",
      "\n",
      "the executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a head unless\n",
      "there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\n",
      "thing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "the king’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be\n",
      "beheaded, and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.\n",
      "\n",
      "the queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it in less\n",
      "than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (it was this last\n",
      "remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)\n",
      "\n",
      "alice could think of nothing else to say but ‘it belongs to the duchess:\n",
      "you’d better ask her about it.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘she’s in prison,’ the queen said to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’\n",
      "and the executioner went off like an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      " the cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,\n",
      "by the time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely\n",
      "disappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down\n",
      "looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.\n",

      "they walked off together.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought\n",
      "to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so\n",
      "savage when they met in the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘when i’m a duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone\n",
      "though), ‘i won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at all. soup does very\n",
      "well without--maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,’\n",
      "she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of\n",
      "rule, ‘and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes\n",
      "them bitter--and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children\n",
      "sweet-tempered. i only wish people knew that: then they wouldn’t be so\n",
      "stingy about it, you know--’\n",
      "\n",
      "she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time, and was a little\n",
      "startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. ‘you’re thinking\n",
      "about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. i can’t\n",
      "tell you just now what the moral of that is, but i shall remember it in\n",
      "a bit.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘perhaps it hasn’t one,’ alice ventured to remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘tut, tut, child!’ said the duchess. ‘everything’s got a moral, if only\n",
      "you can find it.’ and she squeezed herself up closer to alice’s side as\n",
      "she spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\n",
      "duchess was very ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\n",
      "right height to rest her chin upon alice’s shoulder, and it was an\n",
      "uncomfortably sharp chin. however, she did not like to be rude, so she\n",
      "bore it as well as she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘the game’s going on rather better now,’ she said, by way of keeping up\n",
      "the conversation a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘’tis so,’ said the duchess: ‘and the moral of that is--“oh, ‘tis love,\n",
      "‘tis love, that makes the world go round!”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘somebody said,’ alice whispered, ‘that it’s done by everybody minding\n",
      "their own business!’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ah, well! it means much the same thing,’ said the duchess, digging her\n",
      "sharp little chin into alice’s shoulder as she added, ‘and the moral\n",
      "of that is--“take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\n",
      "themselves.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘how fond she is of finding morals in things!’ alice thought to herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i dare say you’re wondering why i don’t put my arm round your waist,’\n",
      "the duchess said after a pause: ‘the reason is, that i’m doubtful about\n",

      "\n",
      "‘he might bite,’ alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to\n",
      "have the experiment tried.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘very true,’ said the duchess: ‘flamingoes and mustard both bite. and\n",
      "the moral of that is--“birds of a feather flock together.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘only mustard isn’t a bird,’ alice remarked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘right, as usual,’ said the duchess: ‘what a clear way you have of\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘of course it is,’ said the duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\n",
      "everything that alice said; ‘there’s a large mustard-mine near here. and\n",

      "yours.”’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘oh, i know!’ exclaimed alice, who had not attended to this last remark,\n",
      "‘it’s a vegetable. it doesn’t look like one, but it is.’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘i quite agree with you,’ said the duchess; ‘and the moral of that\n",
      "is--“be what you would seem to be”--or if you’d like it put more\n",
      "simply--“never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\n",
      "appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise\n",
      "than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.”’\n",
      "\n",

      "‘a cheap sort of present!’ thought alice. ‘i’m glad they don’t give\n",

      "down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till i’ve finished.’\n",
      "\n",
      "so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to\n",

      "saying, ‘thank you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could\n",
      "not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said\n",
      "nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘when we were little,’ the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,\n",
      "though still sobbing a little now and then, ‘we went to school in the\n",

      "\n",
      "‘why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘we called him tortoise because he taught us,’ said the mock turtle\n",

      "\n",
      "‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’\n",
      "added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor\n",
      "alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the gryphon said\n",
      "to the mock turtle, ‘drive on, old fellow! don’t be all day about it!’\n",
      "and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘i never said i didn’t!’ interrupted alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you did,’ said the mock turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘hold your tongue!’ added the gryphon, before alice could speak again.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "‘reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the mock turtle\n",

      "\n",

      "you are a simpleton.’\n",
      "\n",
      "alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she\n",
      "turned to the mock turtle, and said ‘what else had you to learn?’\n",
      "\n",
      "‘well, there was mystery,’ the mock turtle replied, counting off\n",
      "the subjects on his flappers, ‘--mystery, ancient and modern, with\n",
      "seaography: then drawling--the drawling-master was an old conger-eel,\n",

      "\n",

      "creatures hid their faces in their paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘and how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said alice, in a hurry to\n",
      "change the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘ten hours the first day,’ said the mock turtle: ‘nine the next, and so\n",

      "\n",
      "‘what a curious plan!’ exclaimed alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘that’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the gryphon remarked:\n",

      "\n",
      "this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little\n",

      "\n",

      "said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in\n",
      "the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears\n",
      "running down his cheeks, he went on again:--\n",
      "\n",
      "‘you may not have lived much under the sea--’ [‘i haven’t,’ said\n",

      "\n",
      "‘swim after them!’ screamed the gryphon.\n",

      "turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been\n",
      "jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly\n",
      "and quietly, and looked at alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "‘it must be a very pretty dance,’ said alice timidly.\n",

      "all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter, and,\n",
      "just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\n",

      "\n",
